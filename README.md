# The Lang-uisable Project

A best of breed demo series to show the ideal idiomatic representation of code for many programming languages via a common desktop application in Scala, Go, C#, Python, Java, R, Julia, F#, C++, Ballerina, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript etc

There are a few projects that compare different programming languages but they tend to either be focused on comparison benchmarking or generic type "rosetta stones" that show small snippets of code in each language.

The idea here is to use a small but complete program and then struture it in a manner that best shows off the "native" (AKA idiomatic) style of that language. The overall motivation is the "polyglot" of languages found in modern large scale distributed systems and helping people to see what fluency in each language looks like as they transition from one to another in the course of a single project. I am not interested in any discussion surrounding which language is "better" but instead what is the "best" of each language.

For a demo, I am thinking perhaps a simple time tracker UI using a common API with a backend coded in a single language. I want to avoid using backend code for this effort and instead focus on something people can run and play with on their own computers.
