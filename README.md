The Lang-uisable Project

A best of breed demo series to show the ideal idiomatic representation of code for many programming languages via a common desktop application in Scala, Go, C#, Python, Java, R, Julia, F#, C++, Ballerina, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript etc

There are a few projects that compare different programming languages but they tend to either be focused on comparison benchmarking or generic type "rosetta stones" that show small snippets of code in each language.

The idea here is to use a small but complete program and then struture it in a manner that best shows off the "native" (AKA idiomatic) style of that language.

I'm thinking perhaps a simple time tracker UI using a common API with a backend coded in a single language.
